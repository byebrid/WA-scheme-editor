1C,1,sbyte,Round Time The amount of time before sudden death is triggered. Values: 0x00=sudden death triggering on the first turn, 0x01 to 0x7F=represent minutes, 0x80 to 0xFF=represent seconds, in a way that 0xFF=1s and 0x80=128s.
1D,1,byte,Number of Rounds The number of round wins required to win the match. Values: 0x00=1, Other=represent number of rounds

28,1,bool,Super Weapons When enabled, super weapons may appear in weapon crate drops (see Crate probability). Values: 0x00=Off?, 0x01=On?, Other=?
