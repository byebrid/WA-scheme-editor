# Changing Options
A lot of the options are intuitive enough but some have incredibly odd behaviours:

- [Fall Damage](https://worms2d.info/Fall_Damage "Fall Damage")
- [Water Rise Rate](https://worms2d.info/Sudden_Death "Water Rise Rate") (See *Flooding Speed*)
- [Crate Probabilities](https://worms2d.info/Crate_probability "Crate Probabilities") (Weapons, Health and Utilities)
- [Hazardous objects](https://worms2d.info/Hazardous_Objects "Hazardous objects") (How many mines and/or oil drums appear)

Some options' behaviour also change depending on whether or not the value you input is <= or > 127. For example, if Turn Time is set from 0-127, this will represent how many seconds you have per turn. If it's set from 128-255, the timer simply counts up. These options should have help text in the editor with the info you need.
